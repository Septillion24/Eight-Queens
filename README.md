# Eight-Queens

This project is one that I was assigned to do as a school project

## Goal

The goal of this project is to create an AI algorithm to find locations where eight queens can fit on a chess board. This algorithm uses a random-restart hill-climbing method to achieve this.

## Functionality

When the project is run, the algorithm will process states until it finds one that has no conflicts. The number of restarts and iterations are printed to the console as well as a graphic of the board for each step.

## Future functionality

- Add the option to step through each state change
- Add the option to increase the size of the board
- Add support for boards that are not square
